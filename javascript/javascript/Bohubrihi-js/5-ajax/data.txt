Data for the Web
The robots.txt and humans.txt files describe a website's content for web crawlers and people. In a similar way, a data.txt file describes a website's content for data discovery and access.

A data.txt file is a file describing one or many data sources available through your website. Each entry must contain a 'path' attribute to point to the location of each data source, it can also contain optional attributes like 'description', 'license', 'name', and so on.

The specification is under active development, it is intended to be a subset of yaml to make it secure and easy to parse with existing or custom parsers.
